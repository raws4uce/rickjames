#Separate vocals from background music in a mixed audio file using:
#STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
#Masking heuristics or NMF
#ISTFT to reconstruct separated signals
#
# Week 1: STFT / ISTFT Pipeline
#  Load mono .wav file
#  Implement STFT (use rustfft, ndarray)
#  Display magnitude spectrogram
#  Implement ISTFT and reconstruct original signal
#  Verify accuracy (reconstruction â‰ˆ input)
#
# Week 2: Spectrogram Masking
#  Implement simple heuristic masking (e.g. median filtering or energy threshold)
#  Apply mask and reconstruct vocals vs accompaniment
#  Listen to results, tune parameters
#
# Week 3: NMF-based Separation
#  Implement NMF using alternating minimisation
#  Decompose magnitude spectrogram
#  Assign basis vectors to sources manually
#  Apply mask and reconstruct
#
# Week 4: Visualisation + Polish
#  Add CLI args or config
#  Plot spectrograms with plotters
#  Optional: egui UI to view spectrum in real time
#  Package + write README
