im interested in audio.
compatable with (mono,stereo | PCM - 16, 24, 32)

one executable allows you to mask audio of your choosing, it outputs visable and audible versions of the spectrogram
optional masking of your audio where only top n% of frequencies are kept

the other pp.rs preprocesses random 10s samples of audio into 100 x 128 matricies, which is parsed into .npy 
teaching a model to detect genre, (rock, jazz, grime, electric, drum and bass)

PROBLEM(S)
 
TODO 
CLI, use clap good crate
machine learning, idk how but we have data to feed
