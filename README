im interested in audio.
all this does is take in a wav file from the samples folder (mono,stereo | bitrange - 16, 24, 32)
reads it as a vector
normalises it within the ranges of [-1,1]
applies the short time fourier transform algorithm which gives you the spectrogram
in main.rs i use the plotters crate to visualise it.
the graphs are poorly iillustrated, but the x axis is basically time (each frame), 
and the y axis is the magnitude, so real^2 + imaginary^2 = mag^2. 
for stereo, the red points represent the 1st channel (left), and black represents the 2nd channel (right)

TODO 
might take machine learning route now.
