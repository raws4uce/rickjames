im interested in audio.
input .wav file from samples folder (mono,stereo | PCM - 16, 24, 32)
applies short time fourier transform algorithm which gives you the spectrogram, 
visualised by plotters crate. where the x axis is time (frames), y axis is the magnitude 
for stereo, the red points represent the 1st channel (left), and black represents the 2nd channel (right)

optional masking of your audio where only top n% of frequencies are kept and the rest discarded
Now outputs are accurate for (mono, stereo | bitrange - 16, 24, 32,)

PROBLEM(S)
 
TODO 
CLI, use clap good crate
machine learning, idk how but we have data to feed
